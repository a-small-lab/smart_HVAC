```{r}
df <- read.csv("data_sensor_211_wall_back.csv")
df
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(psych)

corr = df %>% select(-timestamp) %>% princomp()
df %>% select(-timestamp) %>% pairs.panels()
```

Two clusters to start with, clean vs dirty basically
Euclidian distance
Eventually verify the clustering boundary
Gaussian mixture could allow for probabilities of being in a given cluster
Once concept of occupancy, predict it with a probability then optimize
COnditional distribution of other variables 

```{r}
library(ggpubr)
library(factoextra)
df %>% select(-pm10_est, -timestamp) %>% kmeans(3) -> kmeans
fviz_cluster(kmeans, data = df %>% select(-pm10_est, -timestamp),
             palette = c("#2E9FDF", "#00AFBB"), 
             geom = "point",
             ellipse.type = "convex", 
             ggtheme = theme_bw()
             )
```
