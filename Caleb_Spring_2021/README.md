# HVAC System Analysis
In UVA's LinkLab, as a part of the Living Link Lab Program, there is a significant amount of environmental, occupancy data, and HVAC system operational data available for analysis. This presents an opportunity for a detailed case study of the performance of an HVAC system among multiple metrics outside of just temperature and humidity with the intention of improving HVAC control systems' ability to maintain occupant comfort with reduced energy consumption. Investigation of multiple metrics of occupant comfort, whether a given room even has occupants which require comfort, various metrics of system operation, and energy consumption consumption (actual and calculated) has the potential to produce a environmental model which may aid in the development of an improved policy for the HVAC system control problem. 

Considering HVAC usage accounts for 30% of total commercial building energy consumption (US Dept. of Energy Commissioned Report on Energy Savings Potential and RD&D Opportunities for Commercial Building HVAC Systems, 2017), there is significant environmental and economic incentive to reducing the energy load of HVAC systems both for regulators and commercial operators. This same commissioned report cites "Technology Enhancements for Current Systems" as one of four groups of high priority technology options, with  "Advanced HVAC Sensors" as the top ranked technology within this category at an estimated Technical Energy Savings Potential (Quadrillion BTU/yr.) of 0.63, lending particular credence to the idea that advanced sensing combined with more efficient control could be a significant contributor to reduced HVAC system burden on energy resources.

This project will investigate the first phase of determining if it possible to create a more efficient control policy for HVAC systems by developing a model of energy consumption calculated from system operation metrics, validating this model with a limited amount of actual collected energy usage data, and attempting to forecast energy demand with this data.
